Experiment 1: Tree & index generation stats.  Index generation time includes I/O (read time of datafile); Tree generation time does not include I/O.

Experiment 2: Tree & index generation stats.  Neither Tree nor Index generation time include I/O.

Experiment 3: Point query and KNN query stats.  Exception for 1 data set.

Experiment 4: Point, Range & KNN query stats.  Exception for 1 range query.

Experiment 5: Point, Range & KNN query stats.  Queries fixed.  No exceptions.

Experiment 6: Range queries with incrementally changing values of theta against a distribution with a single cluster.

Experiment 7: Same as experiment 5, but with extra pruning logic from Liessman in the KNN queries

Experiment 8: Execute multiple wide range queries against a skewed clustered distribution

Experiment 9: Execute multiple narrow range queries against a skewed clustered distribution
