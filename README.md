# iminmax
An implementation of the iMinMax multidimensional indexing method with extensions.

This project is based primarily on the work published in the following 2 papers:

Indexing the edgesâ€”a simple and yet efficient approach to high-dimensional indexing by Beng Chin Ooi, Kian-Lee Tan, Cui Yu and Stephane Bressan

Decreasing Radius K-Nearest Neighbor Search using Mapping-based Indexing Schemes by Qingxiu Shi and Bradford G. Nickerson

Our implementation supports * the iMinMax indexing algorithm * iMinMax point queries * iMinMax range queries * iMinMax K nearest neighbor queries * variable values of a master control knob, theta * search for optimal theta through the use of a distribution median
