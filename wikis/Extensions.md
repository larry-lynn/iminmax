## Finding Optimal Theta Value

In iMinMax, theta is a tunable parameter to account for skewed data 
distributions. Here, we present a programmatic approach for optimizing 
theta based on the median of the data. In this iMinMax implementation, 
the median can be calculated either exactly or approximately as a 
preprocessing step. The median value is then used to calculate a 
close-to-optimal theta.

A d-dimensional median is calculated by first finding the median 
for each dimension. The combination of these d one-dimensional 
medians forms the median point used to calculate the optimal theta.

The formula to calculate the optimal theta can be derived from the 
conditional statement of the equation for indexing points using 
the xmin and xmax values of the median point:

*Î¸<sub>opt</sub> = 1 - x<sub>min</sub> - x<sub>max</sub>*

This theta is intended to evenly split the data between the max and min edges which results in more efficient indexing.

## Experimental Results

We tested our algorithm for determining the optimal theta value on a dataset of 100,000 2d points with a normal distribution centered at (.2,.2). The optimal theta for this distribution that was calculated by our algorithm was 0.6. We compared the performance of trees generated using a variety of values for theta, using range queries that were above, below, and intersected by the the splitting line generated by the optimal theta. We found that the tree generated using the optimal theta calculated by our algorithm performed the best.
